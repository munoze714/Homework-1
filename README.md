# Homework-1
Horiseon Online
In this home work i worked on an online Web development Company website. I first cleaned up css code by organizing classed and Id's.
combining section and articles classes and Id's. Next putting in different Element and alt take to make it manageable for future
changes. I felt comfortable with this homework because im very big on organizization.
